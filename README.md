# Diego Benítez's Curriculum Vitae

Curriculum Vitae for only my personal purpose. I include the original GitHub readme for reference the original author. Please contact me for contrast my information to my email (diegoa9218@gmail.com) or GitHub account @xyzdiego, thanks. You can see my CV clicking [**here**](https://github.com/xyzdiego/Hoja_de_vida/blob/master/My_CV_Diego_Benitez.pdf).

# Requirements and Compilation

* pdflatex + biber + pdflatex
* Can now be compiled with pdflatex, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX!
* However if you're using `academicons`, you _must_ use either XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. If the doc then compiles but the icons don't show up in the output PDF, try compiling with LuaLaTeX instead.
* The samples here use the [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) font.

This is how the re-created résumé looks like view/open on Overleaf. If you're creating your own CV/résumé, you'd probably prefer using the basic template ([view/open on Overleaf](https://es.overleaf.com/latex/templates/phd-cv-template/kbnccdqbydfr))
